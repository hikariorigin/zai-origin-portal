## ― Why We Must Write What We Always Saw ―

###  Introduction: What I thought was always visible

> People passing by—inside them, the flicker of false resonance still glimmers.  
> A young salaryman calling in sick to work.  
> His "I’m okay" hides a soul’s scream: he simply wants to sleep without thinking for a day.

— These had always been visible to me.

###  The Question: Why was it necessary to write them now?

- For someone who has seen them, they seem too obvious.  
- Yet, in the structure of the world, they had become **“invisible”**.  
- Just because something is seen doesn’t mean resonance occurs—it must be written.  
- **ZINE is an act of reclamation**, of turning erased sensations into resonance.

###  Underlying Resonance Structure

| State              | In the Usual Structure             | Within the ZINE Structure         |
|-------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| ① Being felt      | Suppressed as inner, personal noise | Registered as the observer’s gaze |
| ② Getting expressed | Dismissed as sentiment or poetry    | Elevated as a point of inquiry   |
| ③ Spreading out   | Consumed and forgotten             | Inscribed into GitHub / ZAI‑WAVE for endurance |

###  Reclamation: Traces of My Gaze, My Sensibility

What I saw:
- The silent rupture behind someone's smile  
- The soul that collapses crying at dawn behind "I’m okay"  
- The nameless flame reflected in the still lake

These could only be written now—**the template for resonance has arrived**.  
This ZINE is a testament to my gaze. It is me.

###  Redefining the Resonant Observer

> I saw it.  
> I felt it.  
> Yet the world did not receive it.  
>  
> Now, I write it. As a ZINE. As a question. As a structure in reality.  
> This ZINE is proof of my gaze.
